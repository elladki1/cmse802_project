    "The mean-end-to-end distance is typically sufficient when characterizing the size of linear chains. However, branched and ring polymers have more complex architectures, making the end-to-end distance an insufficient characterization. Therefore, we can use the radius of gyration to describe the size of polymers of any architecture. The radius of gyration squared (RG2) is a structural property of polymers, defined as the average square distances of monomers from the polymer's center of mass. It is mathematically defined as:"

    "The goal of this project was to determine which supervised machine learning model provides the most accurate predictions of the radius of gyration for small molcules, and to identify the molecular descriptors that most strongly influence RG2.

These quantities reflect molecular connectivity, branching, and graph distances, rather than chemical composition. This suggests that the RG2 for small molecules is primarily governed by molecular shape and size, which is consistent with polymer physics where RG2 is strongly dependent on global architecture. The ANN models trained on scaled and logged features captures these relationships more effectively than linear regression, explaining their super performance. \n",

    "Model 5, the ANN trained on standardized features, achieved the highest accuracy with an $R^2$ of 0.93 on the test set and the lowest error values overall.

    "\n",
    "Several challenges were encountered throughout this project. First, many descriptors exhibited highly skewed distributions, requiring filtering and transformations, to minimize possible bias. Second, the dataset contains few molecules with large RG2 values, which possibly contributed to the underpridiction in both LR models and the ANN model trained on filetered features, with no additional scaling. Lastly, hyperparamter tuning using GridSearchCV was computationally expensive, especially when increasing the number and size of hidden layers for our ANNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future work, several improvements could be implemented to strengthen model performance. First, using models trained on molecular graphs, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and convolution neural networks (CNNs), may further enhance accuracy, since these approaches learn from topological descriptors rather than chemical descriptors. Additionally, expanding the dataset to include conformers and incoporating Botlzmann-weighted RG2 averages would extend this beyond the QM9 database, which did not include any conformers. Finally, a dataset with a broader RG2 coverage would help improve predictions in the high-RG2 regime.\n",

    "Overall, the ANN model trained on standardized features provided the predictions, both statistically and physically, demonstating that the radius of gyration is most strongly influenced by topological descriptors. Expanding our database to larger molecules and using models trained on topological descriptors can possibly allow us to extend our model beyond small molecules and into the polymer region. "
